                a short paragraph about a few things that I feel are important to talk about.
                this may not be a paragraph as much as a rant.
                basically coding is super elite, it amongsth the greatest minds who have ever been who have brought this technology to us.
                no enought can be said about the few who gain the abiltiys to understand evertyhing there is to understand through the simple and perfect language that is computer language.
                I am very happy to bring these thoughts to you as I am diving deep into this amazing world.  
                thank you for taking the time to read I have to get back to designing this project.
